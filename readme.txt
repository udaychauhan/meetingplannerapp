Hi,

This ReadMe describes the way to use this app and what to expect from it.

So as the name suggests this is a Meeting Planner App.

In this app there are two types of user one is Admin and other is Normal user. This authorization can be chosed when you signup.

--- NORMAL USER
If you are a normal user you will be redirected to your calendar. In that calendar view it will contain all the meetings that you were assigned by the admin. You can only view those meetings.

To view a meeting for particular day, it will be visible by small icon on that day which will suggest that a meeting is present or not.. So click on a day to view meeting for that day. Meetings are detailed information of where , purpose and time of meeting.

As a normal user, you will get real time update about update, delete and addition of meeting. Also there will be an email sent for same.

--- ADMIN USER
If you are an admin, after login you will be redirected to an all user page which shows the users present on databse and you can click on calendar button to go furhter to that user calendar.

When you are in a user's calendar, you can add a meeting, also you can update and delete a meeting by the icons beside the meeting description.

If you are on a user's page you will get realtime update on any activity preformed by another admin on that same user. No email woud be sent to the admin.


That's pretty much it. Hope you enjoy the app.
